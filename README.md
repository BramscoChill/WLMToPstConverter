Windows live mail to pst converter

Convert your windows live mail folder to an *.pst file

I was really annoyed there wasn't an free / good working tool to import *.eml files in outlook. Somehow this is not working smooth in a way i could find.

1) Select an base folder (like the one of windows live mail) with *.eml files in it, they will be converted recursively as nested folders in the *.pst file
2) Select an output *.pst file
3) press convert
